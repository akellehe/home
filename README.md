# Done is better than perfect.

I have a number of projects on my github. It's kind of my warehouse for active and inactive projects alike. I do my best to index stuff that's worthwhile here. If something doesn't appear in the list below it should be considered stale. 

## Projects worth checking out: 

* libconnie - Infer underlying networks. Fast c++ implementation of pyconnie.
* pyconnie - Toy code of libconnie. The prototype.
* graphism - monte carlo simulations on network graphs in python. This is toy code, but interesting. 
* mongoengine-talk - The source for a talk on optimizing mongoengine in high-throughput applications.
* caliendo - A project for testing in python. Still under relatively active development.
